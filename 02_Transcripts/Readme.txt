All our subjects requested confidential treatment of the full transcript upon signing the data protection declaration. 
Since contextual identification of participants cannot be ruled out even with anonymization of the texts, we respect this decision of our subjects. 
In the next folder, there is a collection of quotes identified as relevant from the interviews, in accordance with the data protection agreement. 
If there is still a desire to view the full transcripts, this can be requested through the author of the study.
